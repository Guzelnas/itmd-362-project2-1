## Booking System
A menu displaying pizza items available for order. Here people will be able to order
pizza from a menu by choosing what they want. Also, they will be able to add extra
ingredients, or remove an ingredient they do not want. In addition, they can add
a drink, or sides. They can choose payment options, and whether they want to pick-up,
dine-in, or delivery. If dine-in, we could have them reserve a time and table for
the amount of people. Lastly, we can have it remember the order if they return to
the page before so that it is less tedious, and more user friendly.
