# Tech-Warriors Project 2 Proposal

## Team Members

Dartor Bolo  

## Booking System
A menu displaying pizza items available for order. Here people will be able to build a
pizza from scratch by choosing a pizza size, crust, sauce, toppings, sides, drinks,
and more. Users will be able to pay for food online with a credit card (pick-up
or delivery only) or in person (pick-up only). If people choose to dine in, they
can reserve a table for a certain time. Lastly, we can have it remember the order
if they return to the page before so that it is less tedious, and more user friendly.
