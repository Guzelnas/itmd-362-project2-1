## Booking System
A menu displaying food items available for order. Here people will be able to order
food from a menu by choosing what they want. Also, they will be able to add extra
ingredients, or remove an ingredient they do not want. In addition, they can add
a drink, or sides. They can choose payment options, and whether they want to pick-up,
dine-in, or to-go. If dine-in, we could have it to if they prefer to sit at a table or
booth. Lastly, we can have it remember the order if they return to the page before
so that it is less tedious, and more user friendly.
